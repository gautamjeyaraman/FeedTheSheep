# How to play the game
You can chose the layout you want to explore from this page.


Rules of the game:
You are a sheep, very hungry and want to eat as much as possible without tiring yourself.
Be careful, you might hit an obstacle and get hurt. You are no superman to run over them.
You can become one by eating up as much grass. 
You cannot run away, we want your wool.

How to win:
  - More the grass you eat, stronger you become. More the distance you travel, more tired you become. 
So, you win if the percentage of area covered by you is greater than the previous high scorer.
If its the same we consider the distance you have travelled
