![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gautamjeyaraman/FeedTheSheep/master/screen_shots/2.png "Game")
- You are a sheep, very hungry and want to eat as much as possible without tiring yourself.
- Be careful, you might hit an obstacle and get hurt. You are no superman to run over them.
- You may become one by having grass.
- You cannot run away, we want your wool.

###How to win:
######**More the grass you eat, stronger you become. More the distance you travel, more tired you become.**

- So, you win if the percentage of area covered by you is greater than the previous high scorer.
If its the same we consider the distance you have travelled

###Super Powers
- We believe you are intelligent enough to think of better solutions. There is a reset button for that.
- We believe you can beat your own high score. You can Submit as many times. (!!!Although we take in submissions only if you beat a score!!!)
- We believe you can get bored of the level, so you can go back to Main Menu and select another one
